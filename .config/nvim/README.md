## Neovim Configuration

I started off setting up my configs using nvim kickstarter, which is an absolutely killer
setup from the start. Over time, I added my own plugins and moved around some things to get this setup
the way I wanted it to be.

I then went back and reordered everything to live in its own files so it was a little easier to manage
where things were and when things happen. If you use nvim kickstart, you don't have to do what I did here.

If you want to use it directly, just drop it in your `.config/nvim` directory and it should work. 

Feel free to file an issue if you have problems and I can take a look. Or better yet, pitch any fixes in a PR.

Thanks!
